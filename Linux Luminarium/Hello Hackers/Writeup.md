## Intro to Commands

In this challenge we need to invoke our first command.

```bash
$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{redacted}
```

## Intro to Arguments

In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the `hello` command (NOT the `echo` command) with a single argument of `hackers`.

```bash
$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{redacted}
```

## Command History

We type a lot of commands in the terminal. We can use upward or download key to scroll through the recently typed commands but there is another command which shows the entire commands' history we can used in our session.

```bash
$ history
the flag is pwn.college{redacted}
```
