## TCP/IP

- It is a framework model used for communication between the sender and receiver in the network.
- Consists of various layers which provide levels of abstraction to the data and encapsulate it and after the data received by the sender, the encapsulation is reversed to unpack the packing to get the raw data.



## Internet Layer

- Finds the best possible route to take our data packets from source to destination.
- This route can change over time due to increase in network traffic, latency, delay issues etc.



## Transport Layer

- Above the Internet Layer.
- Once we reach our destination computer or device we need to send that data to the right program or services assigned to particular port since the OS will have multiple applications and programs running at the same time.



## Application Layer

- It acts as the interface between the user and the application.
- It provides services to various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS etc.
