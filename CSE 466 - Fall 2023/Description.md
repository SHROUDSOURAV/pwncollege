Learning the fundamentals of modern stack-based buffer overflows.
You'll gain two main things from these modules:

1. Experience with stack-based buffer overflows in a relatively modern environment with common mitigations enabled.
2. Improved creative and lateral thinking skills from the Shellcoding and Sandboxing modules. These modules help you develop the right mindset for dealing with real-world exploitation constraints, even though the situations are contrived.
